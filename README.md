This adds mates to RimWorld!

What are mates you ask? Its a non alcoholic, non addictive thing we drink in Argentina (and some other places too)!

START: Plant some yerba mate trees and start creating some mates (on the drug spot/table) and allow your colonists to drink mates for fun!

It allows your colonists to talk, and gives a small boost.
